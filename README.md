# odin-recipes

This project is aimed at building a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page that will feature links to a few recipes. Each recipe page will display ingredients, instructions, and images, providing a simple yet functional cooking resource.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:

- Basic structure of an HTML document
- Creating and organizing lists (e.g., ingredients and steps)
- Adding links and images to pages
- Manipulating text for clarity and design
- Structuring a multi-page website

This project serves as a solid foundation for understanding how websites are built, focusing on essential HTML elements and their relationships.
